## Overview

This repository contains Python code to calculate the probability of obtaining a certain combo of Animal Crossing: New Horizons starter villagers. The calculation involves selecting one villager from the "Jock" category and one from the "Sisterly" category.

---

## 1. Count all Jocks and all Sisterlies

```python
# Execute the following code to count the number of Jock and Sisterly villagers

Jocks: 57
Sisterlies: 26
```

## 2. Calculate the Probability

```python
# Execute the following code to calculate the probability of obtaining a certain combo

P(A) = 0.0006896551724137932  (0.069%)
```

---

## 3. Villager Chooser

```python
# Run this code to randomly select starter villagers for your island

nwhite has restarted the island. Their starter villagers are Axel and Paula
```

## Villager Combo Probability Calculator (by Experiments)

```python
# Run this code to conduct experiments and calculate the probability based on the results

Total attempts: 14446525
Mid attempts: 1445
Middle probability: 0.0006922079877340745  (0.069%)
Experiments taken: 10000
```

### Note:

- For accurate results, ensure you have defined the lists of Jock and Sisterly villagers (`villagersList1` and `villagersList2`) before running the code.

- Click Ctrl+C (on Windows or GNU/Linux)/Cmd[‚åò]+C (on macOS) while having the experimental process to interrupt this process and begin to calculate the statistics based on results stored in the memory

- If you encounter a `NameError`, run the first code snippet to define the required lists.
